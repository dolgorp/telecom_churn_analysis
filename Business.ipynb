    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This project predicts customer churn in a telecommunication company using machine learning tools to analyze historical data on customer behavior, service usage, and location factors.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to identify patterns that signal when a customer is likely to cancel their service. By leveraging predictive models such as logistic regression or decision trees, the company can proactively intervene with targeted offers or improved services to retain at-risk customers.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will utilize a dataset of SyriaTel customer interactions and subscription details, applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to develop an accurate churn prediction model. This approach not only enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty but also significantly reduces loss in revenue."

    "## Business understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "[Churn management is the concept of identifying those customers who intend to move their custom to a competing service provider.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054805003503?via%3Dihub)\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing customer churn is crucial for telecommunications companies due to its direct impact on profitability. High churn rates reflect customer dissatisfaction, which not only results in lost revenue but also increases the cost associated with acquiring new customers. [Getting a new customer can cost five to twenty-five times more than keeping an existing customer.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-023-05389-6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have shown that even a small reduction in churn can significantly boost the company's revenue. For example, [a 5% reduction in churn can increase profits by 25% to 95% depending on the industry context](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-023-05389-6). This substantial effect arises because retained customers are likely to buy more over time and often cost less to serve due to their familiarity with the service and products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, predictive analytics in churn prevention allows telecom companies to identify at-risk customers early on, enabling them to take targeted actions to retain these customers. This proactive approach not only saves money but also improves customer satisfaction and loyalty by addressing their concerns before they lead to defection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, with the telecom industry being highly competitive, maintaining customer loyalty through effective churn management strategies can provide a significant edge over competitors, as it ensures a stable revenue stream and reduces the volatility of the customer base.\n",
